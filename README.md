# BoggleGame

The Game:

Boggle is a word game designed by Bill Cooke, invented by Allan Turoff and originally distributed by Parker Brothers.
Each player searches for words that can be constructed from the letters of sequentially adjacent cubes, where "adjacent" cubes are those horizontally, vertically, and diagonally neighboring. Words must be at least four letters long.

Purpose: 

This C++ version is my implementation of the Assignment 4 of the CS106B course at Stanford.

Demo: 

My demo for this project is available on youtube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw_z1ThnaHA

Installing: 

This is a C++ QT creator project that can be imported directly by opening the file: Boggle/Boggle.pro on your QT IDE.
